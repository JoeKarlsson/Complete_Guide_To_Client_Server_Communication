# Complete Guide To Client Server Communication

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/JoeKarlsson/complete-guide-to-client-server-communication.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A complete list of all the ways a Client and Server communicate with each other in JavaScript and Node. This module covers the following forms of client server connection:

* XMLHttpRequest
* Server-Sent Events
* WebSocket
* HTTP/200
* Server to server

There is no one best protocol or API for client/server communication. Every nontrivial application will require a mix of different transports based on a variety of requirements: interaction with the browser cache, protocol overhead, message latency, reliability, type of data transfer, and more. Some protocols may offer low-latency delivery (e.g., Server-Sent Events, WebSocket), but may not meet other critical criteria, such as the ability to leverage the browser cache or support efficient binary transfers in all cases.

* __XHR__ is optimized for "transactional" request-response communication: the client sends the full, well-formed HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with a full response. There is no support for request streaming, and until the Streams API is available, no reliable cross-browser response streaming API.
* __SSE__ enables efficient, low-latency server-to-client streaming of text-based data: the client initiates the SSE connection, and the server uses the event source protocol to stream updates to the client. The client canâ€™t send any data to the server after the initial handshake.
* __WebSocket__ is the only transport that allows bidirectional communication over the same TCP connection (Figure 17-2): the client and server can exchange messages at will. As a result, WebSocket provides low latency delivery of text and binary application data in both directions.
